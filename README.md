# Introduction to GitHub using basic text files

In this demo, we're going to...

1. Examine the layout and affordances of a GitHub repository
2. Edit a [simple text file](this-is-just-to-say), and talk about commit messages
3. View the file's history and talk about diffs
4. Try again with a more complicated file and talk about what happens
5. See what kinds of files you can create directly on the GitHub website

<!--
4. Upload a .txt file, and compare how it's displayed
5. Upload a .docx file, and compare how it's displayed
6. Change both the .txt and .docx file outside of GitHub, and re-upload
7. View each file's history
